                <h1>Space Weather Prediction</h1>
                <p> I am currently work in an undergraduate reasearch team trying to predict space weather occurences called Sudden Commencements.
                <p> A SC (Sudden Commencement), is an unexpected
                    sharp increase in the Northern (X) magnetic
                    component of a considered observatory. Usually, but
                    not always an SC is the precursor to a geomagnetic
                    storm. </p>                    
                <p> There are two types of Sudden Commencements.
                    Sudden Commencement followed by a magnetic
                    storm/an increase in activity is called a Storm Sudden
                    Commencement (SSC) or by no further disturbance is
                    called a Sudden Impulse (SI)</p>
